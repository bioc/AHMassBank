Description:
    Supplies AnnotationHub with MassBank metabolite/compound annotations
    bundled in CompDb SQLite databases. CompDb SQLite databases contain general
    compound annotation as well as fragment spectra representing fragmentation
    patterns of compounds. MassBank data is retrieved from
    https://massbank.eu/MassBank and processed using helper functions from the
    CompoundDb package into SQLite databases.
